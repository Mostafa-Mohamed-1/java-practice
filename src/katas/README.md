## ✅ GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

This program reads two integers from the user and computes their **greatest common divisor** using the Euclidean algorithm.

---

## ✅ DiagonalStar

This program prints a square star pattern of a given size to the console. It prints stars on the borders and both diagonals, forming a star shape inside the square. The size must be at least 5 for the pattern to be valid.

---

## ✅ PaintJob

This program calculates the number of paint buckets required to paint a wall or area. It provides three overloaded methods to compute the number of buckets needed based on different sets of inputs:

- Width, height, area covered per bucket, and extra buckets already available.
- Width, height, and area covered per bucket.
~~- Total area and area covered pe~~r bucket.

### 🔧 Compile

```bash
javac src/katas/GCD.java
